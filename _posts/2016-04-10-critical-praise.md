> It was willing to say something, whereas a lot of first-time filmmakers wouldn't have swung for the fences like that. You guys get my respect on having the balls enough to say, _you know what, we're not gonna limit ourselves, _which is very refreshing, very impressive.

--- [Rick Ramos][0] (_Watch This_)

> Corruption and collusion to undermine the goodness of what the U.S. was built upon is what _Casualties of the State_ is all about.

--- [Bev Questad][1] (_It's Just Movies_)

> I was struck by the moral ambiguity all throughout the story -- questions of what ends might justify what means, questions of good and evil. A first-rate job.

--- [Jim Althoff][2] (NPR, St. Louis Higher Education Channel, _Frames_)

> Jeremy Cropf direct(s) this Political Thriller with confident precision. This is a thought provoking film that is slickly made. It's great that movies like this are being filmed in St. Louis!
