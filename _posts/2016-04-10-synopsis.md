Casualties of the State follows two FBI agents and a young security analyst as they investigate the murders of high-ranking government officials. As the trio races to catch the killer, they find themselves in an unexpected moral struggle where more is at stake than the lives of the killer's victims.

A tense procedural drama set in the current political landscape, Casualties of the State follows two seasoned FBI agents Jonathan Seeger (David R. Mueller) and Phillip Zoller (Ted Jordan), as they investigate the murder of a high-ranking government official. The NSA tasks young analyst Lucien Archer (Alexander McCormick) to assist, despite differences in their age and mismatched personalities. The stakes are raised when they discover a link to other murder victims, all powerful elites at the highest levels of the political establishment, all conspiring to incite and profit from war. The investigation is called into question by Lucien's supervisor, a sexy, scheming Jillian Danvers (Portia Secor), and the former Vice-President, a senior hardliner with lasting influence, Stuart Wilmot (Paul Russell). As the trio closes in on the killer, they find themselves in a moral struggle where there is more at stake than just the lives of the killer's victims.
